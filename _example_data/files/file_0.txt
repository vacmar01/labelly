MOCK SAMPLE DATA - Brain MRI without and with contrast: No evidence of acute infarct, mass effect, or midline shift. Ventricles and sulci are age-appropriate. Multiple scattered FLAIR hyperintense foci in bilateral subcortical and periventricular white matter, likely representing chronic small vessel ischemic changes. No abnormal enhancement. Normal flow voids in major intracranial vessels. IMPRESSION: Age-related changes without acute findings.
